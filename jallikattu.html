            <p>Jallikattu (or sallikkattu), also known as eru thazhuvuthal and mañcuvirattu,
            is a traditional event in which a bull, such as the Pulikulam or Kangayam breeds,
            is released into a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab 
            the large hump on the bull's back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull
            attempts to escape. Participants hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting
            to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases, participants must ride long enough to 
            remove flags on the bull's horns.
            </p>
            <p>Jallikattu is typically practised in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu as a part
                 of Pongal celebrations on Mattu Pongal day, which occurs annually in January.
            </p>
            <p>As there were incidents of injury and death associated with the sport, both to
            the participants and to the animals forced into it, animal rights organizations have called
            for a ban on the sport, resulting in the court banning it several times over the past years. However,
             with protests from the people against the ban, a new ordinance was made in 2017 to continue the sport.

            <h2>History:</h2>
            <p>Jallikattu has been known to be practiced during the Tamil classical period (400–100 BCE).
            It was common among the Ayar people who lived in the ‘Mullai’ geographical division of
            the ancient Tamil Nadu. Later, it became a platform for display of bravery, and prize money
            was introduced for participation encouragement. A seal from the Indus Valley civilization depicting 
            the practice is preserved in the National Museum, New Delhi. A cave painting in white kaolin discovered 
            near Madurai depicting a lone man trying to control a bull is estimated to be about 1,500 years old.</p>
