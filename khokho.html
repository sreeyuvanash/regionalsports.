            <p>Kho Kho is a traditional Indian sport, being one of
            the oldest outdoor sports dating back to ancient India.
            It is the second most popular traditional tag game in
            the Indian subcontinent after Kabaddi. Kho-Kho is played
            on a rectangular court with a central lane connecting 
            two poles which are at either end of the court. During the
            game, nine players from the chasing team (attacking team)
            are on the field, with eight of them sitting (crouched) in
            the central lane, while three 'runners' from the defending 
            team run around the court and try to avoid being touched. 
            Each sitting player on the chasing team sits facing 
            alternating directions from the central lane.</p>

            <p>At any time, one player on the chasing team 
            (the 'active chaser' or 'attacker') may run around
            the court to attempt to tag (touch) members of the 
            defending team, with one point scored per tag, and
            each tagged defender required to leave the field; 
            however, the active chaser cannot cross the central 
            lane to access the other half of the field, and also 
            must only run in the direction (facing either pole) they
            took their first step in. The chasing team can get around
            these restrictions if the active chaser either switches 
            roles with a sitting teammate (by touching them on the back
            while saying "Kho") who is facing the other half of the court
            and therefore has access to it, or runs to either pole and
            then switches direction/half. Each team has two turns to score
            and two turns to defend, with each turn lasting nine minutes.
            The team that scores the most points by the end of the game wins.</p>

            <p>The sport is widely played across South Asia, and 
            also has a strong presence in the regions outside 
            South Asia, such as South Africa and England. It is
            played most often by school children in India and 
            Pakistan and is a competitive game. The first league 
            of its kind called Ultimate Kho Kho was unveiled in 
            India in August 2022.</p>

            <h2>History:</h2>
            <p>The origin of Kho-Kho is very difficult to trace, but many historians 
            believe that it is a modified form of 'Tag'/'Catch', which in its
            implest form involves chasing and touching a person.Kho-Kho is
            featured in the Ancient Indian Sanskrit epic Mahabharata</p>
            <p>The present appearance of the game was an adoption from the time of
            World War I in 1914. But at that time, there were neither any dimensions of the playground nor the poles which demarcate the central line. The time factor was also missing.</p>
            <p>The Deccan Gymkhana club of Pune, Maharashtra so named and baptized by the great Indian leader Lokmanya Tilak & Bhai Narorkar drafted the first-ever rules and regulations which symbolized the metamorphosis of the game soon to follow. This initial stage marked the limitation of the playground and yet sadly lacked the poles demarking the central line in the field. Instead, less experienced players were posted squatting at the ends of the latter and chasers ran around them to return to the midfield.</p>
            <p>But, even then the game caught the imagination of the experts in the field. The experts took no time to realize that the game demands the highest degree of quick and brisk movements, very high grade of nerve reflexes and tremendous stamina which are characteristic of a supreme athlete. The game requires all motor qualities alike speed, endurance, flexibility, agility, strength and neuromuscular coordination. As per merit, it is appreciated by press, media and spectators. The first Kho-Kho tournaments were organized in 1914, and the first national championship was held in 1959 at Vijayawada under the auspices of the Kho-Kho Federation of India (KKFI), which was formed in 1955.</p>
            <p>The game with its fast pace, so fascinated the spectators that the Governor of Bombay Presidency H.E. Lord Willingdon also admired the merits and potentials of the game. The years 1923-24 saw the foundation of the Inter School Sports Organization, and Kho Kho was introduced to develop at the grassroots and consequently popularize the sport. The move certainly showed the results and the game of Kho Kho mainly owes it to the efforts taken by the Deccan Gymkhana and Hind Vijay Gymkhana.</p>
            <p>In the year 1938, Kho Kho moved one step forward when Akhil Maharashtra Sharirik Shikshan Mandal organized zonal sports at Akola which attracted tremendous response from the budding enthusiasts as well as organizers. The team size was restricted to 9 players per team and sport was played without the poles. At the beginning of the match, players used to take 3 rounds of the court from post to post and then started the match. This needed yet another few reforms which were adopted in 1943 as well as 1945.</p>
            <p>Kho kho was exhibited in Sweden and Denmark in the year 1949 but it didn't leave any effect on the spectators (foreigner). After coming back in 1949, the poles were featured in the game. Also, the 3 rounds at the beginning of the game were reduced to one round from pole to pole. In 1951, even the one round was eliminated. In the year 1955, Akhil Bharatiya Kho Kho Mandal was established and the first ever All India Kho Kho Championship was organized at Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh in 1959-60 under the auspices of Kho Kho Federation of India. The years 1960-61 featured Women's Championship for the first time in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.</p>
            <p>Individual prizes were introduced in the year 1963. Vishwanath Mayekar won the first Man of the Tournament named "Ekalavya Award". The Woman of the Tournament "Rani Laxmibai Award" was claimed by Usha Anantham of Mysore.</p>
            <p>The years 1969 and 1970 featured the Junior age group competitions at Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Youth under 18 Years and Boys under 16 Years of age were two new categories introduced where the best youth player of the tournament was honoured by "Abhimanyu Award". Junior Girls under 16 Years tournament was held in 1974 at Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, where two more categories Sub-Junior Boys under 14 Years and Girls under 12 Years also commenced. The best Sub-Juniors Boy & Girls was awarded "Bharat Award" and "Veer Bala Award" respectively. In 1970, Arjuna Award was awarded to Shri Sudhir Parab from Gujarat.</p>
            <p>In the year 1982, the Kho Kho Federation of India organized Men's and Women's Yearly Championship as Federation Cup. Kho Kho was featured in the Asian Games, 1982 for the first time in New Delhi. It was appreciated by Asian countries. After looking at its grand success Sports Authority of India and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Govt. of India deputed their coaches all over the country to develop the sport of Kho Kho scientifically at grass root level.</p>
            <p>Looking back at its success, it was one of the main featured during 12th South Asian Games, 2016 held at Guwahati, Assam from 5 to 9 February 2016. It happened just because of the sincere efforts of Shri Rajeev Mehta, President, KKFI & Secretary General, IOA. The participating countries were Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and host country India. This tournament was well organized under the leadership of Shri. M. S. Tyagi, Competition Director (Kho Kho). All the Asian countries appreciated and ensured of introducing the sport in their respective countries. 1st Asian Championship took place at Calcutta, West Bengal in 1996 followed by the 2nd Asian Championship in the year 2000 at Dhaka, Bangladesh. The 3rd Asian Championship was held in the month of April 2016 at Indore, Madhya Pradesh. The participating countries were Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Korea and host country India. The test series was played between India and England in Januaryâ€“February, 2017 at different venues in India namely Mumbai, Rajasthan and New Delhi.</p>
            <p>In 1999, The Asian Kho Kho Federation was established during the 3rd edition of the South Asian Games. Member countries included India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Maldives. The 1st Asian Championship was held at Kolkata in 1996 and the second championship at Dhaka, Bangladesh. India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Japan, Thailand were participants of this championship.</p>
            <p>In 2013, the Kho Kho Federation of England was formed by Brij Haldania, who had played competitively for Rajasthan before settling down in United Kingdom. With the aim of developing the game to an international level, he built relationships with M.S Tyagi (Kho-Kho Federation of India), Sudhanshu Mittal (Asian Kho-Kho Federation) and Rajeev Mehta (Indian Olympic Association). With the collaborative efforts of these individuals, the sport has reached new heights. In 2018, the 'International Kho-Kho Federation' was formed to govern and guide the sport of Kho-Kho globally.</p>
            <p>In 2016 a social media platform named KHO-KHO CHAMPIONS made by Prince Raj (14yrs Boy) on all different media and promoted the game from grassroot. Many players have played national under the guidance of KHO-KHO CHAMPIONS. The page is doing well in the field of promotion and making kho kho to a new height by digitally.</p>
            <p>In July 2022, the player draft for "Ultimate Kho Kho" was completed, which is a six-team franchise-based Indian Kho Kho tournament. Its inaugural season ran from August 14 to September 4, 2022. Odisha Juggernauts were the champions of the inaugural season.</p>
