            <p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of
            seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player 
            on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's
            half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, and
            return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the 
            defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored for each player tagged
            by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider.
            Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought
            back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.</p>
            
            <p>It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian
            countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of
            ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the
            20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh. It is the state 
            game of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana,
            Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.</p>

            <p>There are two major disciplines of kabaddi: "Punjabi kabaddi", also referred 
            to as "circle styles", comprises traditional forms of the sport that are 
            played on a circular field outdoors, while the "standard style", played 
            on a rectangular court indoors, is the discipline played in major 
            professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.</p>
            
            <p>This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian 
            subcontinent, such as: kabaddi or chedugudu in Andhra Pradesh and 
            Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabadi
            or ha-du-du in West Bengal and Bangladesh; bhavatik in Maldives,
            kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western 
            India, hu-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in South India; 
            kapardi in Nepal; and kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu.</p>

            <h2>History:</h2>
            <p>Although unverified, theories from various sources state that 
            kabaddi originated from the Vedic period of ancient India,
            speculated to being from present day Haryana. The game was 
            said to have been popular among the Yadava people; an abhang
            by Tukaram stated that the lord Krishna played the game in 
            his youth, while the Mahabharata contains an account of Arjuna
            being able to sneak into hostile areas also take out enemies
            unscathedâ€”a passage said to parallel the gameplay of Kabaddi.
            There are also accounts of Gautam Buddha having played the
            game recreationally.</p>

            <p>Modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various
            forms under different names in the Indian subcontinent.
            India has been first credited with having helped to
            popularise kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the
            first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s,
            their introduction to the programme of the Indian 
            Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the
            All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being
            played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural
            1951 Asian Games in New Delhi. These developments 
            helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally
            been played in villages, for legitimate international competition.</p>
        
            <p>After being demonstrated again at the 1982 Asian Games in
            Delhi, Kabaddi was added to the Asian Games programme beginning in 1990.</p>
