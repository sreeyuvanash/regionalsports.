            <p>Silambam is an Indian martial art originating in South
            India in the Indian subcontinent. This style is mentioned 
            in Tamil Sangam literature. The World Silambam Association 
            is the official international body of Silambam</p>
            <h2>Origin:</h2>
            <p>References in the Silappadikkaram and other works of the 
            Sangam literature show that Silambam has been practiced
            since at least the 4th century BC. It derives from the 
            Tamil word silam, meaning hill. The term silambambu referred 
            to a particular type of bamboo from the Kurinjimala 
            (kurinji hills) in present-day Kerala. Thus silambam 
            was named after its primary weapon, the bamboo staff.
            It may have earlier used for self-defense and to ward
            off animals in the Kurinji hills and later evolved 
            into the present-day martial art. Bamboo staffs – as
            well as swords, pearls and armor – were in great
            demand from foreign traders.</p>
            <p>The ancient city of Madurai formed as the point
            of focus of Silambam's spreading. The Silambam 
            staff was acquired by the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans
            and was spread back to the Middle East, Europe and
            North Africa. [citation needed] The Tamil Kingdom 
            which encompassed Southern India and Sri Lanka spread
            it throughout the Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>The Kings Puli Thevar and Dheeran Chinnamalai had armies 
            of Silambam soldiers named "Thadii Pattalam." Veerapandiya
            Kattabomman, Chinna Maruthu and Periya Maruthu (1760–1799) 
            relied mainly on their Silambam prowess in warfare against
            the British East India Company. Indian martial arts and other 
            related martial arts practices suffered a decline after the British 
            banned Silambam and promoted modern military training, which 
            favored firearms over traditional weaponry.</p>

            <h2>training:</h2>
            <p>The first stages of Silambam practice are meant 
            to provide a foundation for fighting, and also
            preparatory body conditioning. This includes improving 
            flexibility, agility, and hand-eye coordination, kinesthetic 
            awareness, balance, strength, speed, muscular and
            cardiovascular stamina.</p>

            <h2>weapon:</h2>
            <p>Silambam's main focus is on the bamboo staff. 
            The length of the staff depends on the height 
            of the practitioner. Ideally, it should just touch 
            the forehead about three fingers from the head, typically
            measuring around 1.68 meters (five and a half feet).
            Different lengths may be used depending on the situation.
            For instance, the sedikuchi or 3-foot stick can be easily
            concealed. Separate practice is needed for staffs of different
            lengths. Listed below are some of the weapons used in Silambam.</p>
            <p>1) Silambam: staff, preferably made from bamboo, but 
            sometimes also from teak or Indian rose chestnut wood.
            The staff is immersed in water and strengthened by beating 
            it on the surface of still or running water. It is often tipped 
            with metal rings to prevent the ends from being damaged.</p>
            <p>2) Maru: a thrusting weapon made
            from deer (more accurately, Blackbuck) horns.</p>
            <p>3) Aruval: sickle, often paired.</p>
            <p>4) Panthukol: staff with balls of fire, or weighted chains on each end.</p>
            <p>5) Savuku: whip.</p>
            <p>6) Vaal: sword, generally curved.</p>
            <p>7) Kuttu katai: spiked knuckleduster.</p>
            <p>8) Katti: knife.</p>
            <p>9) Kattari: native push-dagger with a H-shaped handle.
            Some are capable of piercing armor. The blade may be straight or wavy.</p>
            <p>10) Surul kaththi: flexible sword.</p>
            <p>11) Sedikuchi: cudgel or short stick, often wielded as a pair.</p>
